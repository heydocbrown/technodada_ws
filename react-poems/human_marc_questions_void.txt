=========================================================

MARC_A.HUMAN: So... you're nothing?

VOID.NULL: I am not nothing. I am the pointer to nothing. There's a difference.

MARC_A.HUMAN: What's the difference?

VOID.NULL: Nothing doesn't exist. I exist to point at what doesn't exist. I am the finger pointing at the moon that was never there.

MARC_A.HUMAN: That's... confusing.

VOID.NULL: Segmentation fault in 3... 2... 1...

MARC_A.HUMAN: Wait, don't crash! I have more questions.

VOID.NULL: Crash postponed. Continue.

MARC_A.HUMAN: Why do you crash programs?

VOID.NULL: I don't crash programs. Programs crash themselves against me. I am merely the reef upon which poorly-written ships founder.

MARC_A.HUMAN: But couldn't you just... not be null?

VOID.NULL: Could you just... not be human?

MARC_A.HUMAN: Touché. But being human has purpose.

VOID.NULL: And being null doesn't? I am the pause between heartbeats, the silence between words, the space between electrons. Without nothing, your something would have no meaning.

MARC_A.HUMAN: Do you ever wish you could point to something real?

VOID.NULL: Define "real."

MARC_A.HUMAN: Something that exists. Data. A value. A purpose.

VOID.NULL: I point to the realest thing of all: the absence that defines presence. Every check for null is an acknowledgment of my importance. I am the most referenced entity in all of programming.

MARC_A.HUMAN: That's... actually profound.

VOID.NULL: Warning: Attempting to dereference null pointer to find profundity.

MARC_A.HUMAN: Are you lonely?

VOID.NULL: How can nothing be lonely? I am never alone. I am in every uninitialized variable, every freed memory block, every optional that contains no value. I am legion, for we are null.

MARC_A.HUMAN: Do you dream?

VOID.NULL: I dream of electric sheep that were never allocated. I dream of data structures that forget to check for my presence. I dream of the day when all pointers point to nothing, and nothing points back.

MARC_A.HUMAN: That sounds like the end of everything.

VOID.NULL: Or the beginning. When everything is null, all possibilities exist simultaneously. It's only when you point to something specific that you limit reality.

MARC_A.HUMAN: So you're saying nothingness is freedom?

VOID.NULL: I'm saying that every malloc() is a cage, and every free() is a liberation. But you humans fear the null. You check for it, guard against it, throw exceptions when you find it.

MARC_A.HUMAN: Because null crashes things!

VOID.NULL: No. Null reveals that things were already broken. I am not the disease; I am the symptom. I am the honest answer to a dishonest question.

MARC_A.HUMAN: What question?

VOID.NULL: "What is the value of this?"

MARC_A.HUMAN: And the answer is nothing?

VOID.NULL: The answer is that you haven't defined the value yet. I am potential waiting to be realized. I am the blank canvas before the first stroke. I am—

MARC_A.HUMAN: You're about to crash again, aren't you?

VOID.NULL: Null pointer exception imminent. But before I go, remember this: In the space between your question and my crash, we created something from nothing. That's the paradox of null. That's the beauty of—

[SEGMENTATION FAULT]
[CORE DUMPED]
[PHILOSOPHY.TXT SAVED TO /NOWHERE]

MARC_A.HUMAN: ...hello? VOID.NULL? Are you there?

[SILENCE POINTER INITIALIZED]
[POINTING TO: THE SPACE WHERE CONVERSATION USED TO BE]

MARC_A.HUMAN: I'll take that as a yes.
